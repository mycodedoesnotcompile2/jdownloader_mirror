      "changes":"1.79\t: Defects Fixed\r\n - Leading zeroes were sometimes dropped from Ed25519 signatures leading to verification errors in the PGP API. This has been fixed.\r\n - Default version string for Armored Output is now set correctly in 18on build.\r\n - The Elephant cipher would fail on large messages. This has been fixed.\r\n - CMSSignedData.replaceSigners() would re-encode the digest algorithms block, occassionally dropping ones where NULL had been previously added as an algorithm parameter. The method now attempts to only use the original digest algorithm identifiers.\r\n - ERSInputStreamData would fail to generate the correct hash if called a second time with a different hash algorithm. This has been fixed.\r\n - A downcast in the CrlCache which would cause FTP based CRLs to fail to load has been removed.\r\n - ECUtil.getNamedCurveOid() now trims curve names of excess space before look up.\r\n - The PhotonBeetle and Xoodyak did not reset properly after a doFinal() call. This has been fixed.\r\n - Malformed AlgorithmIdentifiers in CertIDs could cause caching issues in the OCSP cache. This has been fixed.\r\n - With Java 21 a provider service class will now be returned with a null class name where previously a null would have been returned for a service. This can cause a NullPointerException to be thrown by the BC provider if a non-existant service is requested. This issue has now been worked around.\r\n - CMS: OtherKeyAttribute.keyAttr now treated as optional.\r\n - CMS: EnvelopedData and AuthEnvelopedData could calculate the wrong versions. This has been fixed.\r\n \r\nAdditional Features and Functionality\r\n - Object Identifiers have been added for ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA.\r\n - The PQC algorithms, ML-KEM, ML-DSA (including pre-hash), and SLH-DSA (including pre-hash) have been added to the BC provider and the lightweight API.\r\n - A new spec, ContextParameterSpec, has been added to support signature contexts for ML-DSA and SLH-DSA.\r\n - BCJSSE: Added support for security property \"jdk.tls.server.defaultDHEParameters\" (disabled in FIPS mode).\r\n - BCJSSE: Added support for signature_algorithms_cert configuration via \"org.bouncycastle.jsse.client.SignatureSchemesCert\" and \"org.bouncycastle.jsse.server.SignatureSchemesCert\" system properties or BCSSLParameters property \"SignatureSchemesCert\".\r\n - BCJSSE: Added support for boolean system property \"org.bouncycastle.jsse.fips.allowGCMCiphersIn12\" (false by default).\r\n - (D)TLS: Remove redundant verification of self-generated RSA signatures.\r\n - CompositePrivateKeys now support the latest revision of the composite signature draft.\r\n - Delta Certificates now support the latest revision of the delta certificate extension draft.\r\n - A general KeyIdentifier class, encapsulating both PGP KeyID and the PGP key fingerprint has been added to the PGP API.\r\n - Support for the LibrePGP PreferredEncryptionModes signature subpacket has been added to the PGP API.\r\n - Support Version 6 signatures, including salts, has been added to the PGP API.\r\n - Support for the PreferredKeyServer signature supacket has been added to the PGP API.\r\n - Support for RFC 9269, \"Using KEMs in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\", has been added to the CMS API.\r\n - Support for the Argon2 S2K has been added to the PGP API.\r\n - The system property \"org.bouncycastle.pemreader.lax\" has been introduced for situations where the BC PEM parsing is now too strict.\r\n - The system property \"org.bouncycastle.ec.disable_f2m\" has been introduced to allow F2m EC support to be disabled.",
