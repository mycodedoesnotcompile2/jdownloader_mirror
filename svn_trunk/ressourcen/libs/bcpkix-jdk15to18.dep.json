      "changes":"1.79\t: Defects Fixed\r\n - Leading zeroes were sometimes dropped from Ed25519 signatures leading to verification errors in the PGP API. This has been fixed.\r\n - Default version string for Armored Output is now set correctly in 18on build.\r\n - The Elephant cipher would fail on large messages. This has been fixed.\r\n - CMSSignedData.replaceSigners() would re-encode the digest algorithms block, occassionally dropping ones where NULL had been previously added as an algorithm parameter. The method now attempts to only use the original digest algorithm identifiers.\r\n - ERSInputStreamData would fail to generate the correct hash if called a second time with a different hash algorithm. This has been fixed.\r\n - A downcast in the CrlCache which would cause FTP based CRLs to fail to load has been removed.\r\n - ECUtil.getNamedCurveOid() now trims curve names of excess space before look up.\r\n - The PhotonBeetle and Xoodyak did not reset properly after a doFinal() call. This has been fixed.\r\n - Malformed AlgorithmIdentifiers in CertIDs could cause caching issues in the OCSP cache. This has been fixed.\r\n - With Java 21 a provider service class will now be returned with a null class name where previously a null would have been returned for a service. This can cause a NullPointerException to be thrown by the BC provider if a non-existant service is requested. This issue has now been worked around.\r\n - CMS: OtherKeyAttribute.keyAttr now treated as optional.\r\n - CMS: EnvelopedData and AuthEnvelopedData could calculate the wrong versions. This has been fixed.\r\n \r\nAdditional Features and Functionality\r\n - Object Identifiers have been added for ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA.\r\n - The PQC algorithms, ML-KEM, ML-DSA (including pre-hash), and SLH-DSA (including pre-hash) have been added to the BC provider and the lightweight API.\r\n - A new spec, ContextParameterSpec, has been added to support signature contexts for ML-DSA and SLH-DSA.\r\n - BCJSSE: Added support for security property \"jdk.tls.server.defaultDHEParameters\" (disabled in FIPS mode).\r\n - BCJSSE: Added support for signature_algorithms_cert configuration via \"org.bouncycastle.jsse.client.SignatureSchemesCert\" and \"org.bouncycastle.jsse.server.SignatureSchemesCert\" system properties or BCSSLParameters property \"SignatureSchemesCert\".\r\n - BCJSSE: Added support for boolean system property \"org.bouncycastle.jsse.fips.allowGCMCiphersIn12\" (false by default).\r\n - (D)TLS: Remove redundant verification of self-generated RSA signatures.\r\n - CompositePrivateKeys now support the latest revision of the composite signature draft.\r\n - Delta Certificates now support the latest revision of the delta certificate extension draft.\r\n - A general KeyIdentifier class, encapsulating both PGP KeyID and the PGP key fingerprint has been added to the PGP API.\r\n - Support for the LibrePGP PreferredEncryptionModes signature subpacket has been added to the PGP API.\r\n - Support Version 6 signatures, including salts, has been added to the PGP API.\r\n - Support for the PreferredKeyServer signature supacket has been added to the PGP API.\r\n - Support for RFC 9269, \"Using KEMs in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\", has been added to the CMS API.\r\n - Support for the Argon2 S2K has been added to the PGP API.\r\n - The system property \"org.bouncycastle.pemreader.lax\" has been introduced for situations where the BC PEM parsing is now too strict.\r\n - The system property \"org.bouncycastle.ec.disable_f2m\" has been introduced to allow F2m EC support to be disabled.",

      "changes":"1.80\t: Defects Fixed\r\n - A splitting issue for ML-KEM lead to an incorrect size for kemct in KEMRecipientInfos. This has been fixed.\r\n - The PKCS12 KeyStore has been adjusted to prevent accidental doubling of the Oracle trusted certificate attribute (results in an IOException when used with the JVM PKCS12 implementation).\r\n - The SignerInfoGenerator copy constructor was ignoring the certHolder field. This has been fixed.\r\n - The getAlgorithm() method return value for a CompositePrivateKey was not consistent with the corresponding getAlgorithm() return value for the CompositePrivateKey. This has been fixed.\r\n - The international property files were missing from the bcjmail distribution. This has been fixed.\r\n - Issues with ElephantEngine failing on processing large/multi-block messages have been addressed.\r\n - GCFB mode now fully resets on a reset.\r\n - The lightweight algorithm contestants: Elephant, ISAP, PhotonBeetle, Xoodyak now support the use of the AEADParameters class and provide accurate update/doFinal output lengths.\r\n - An unnecessary downcast in CertPathValidatorUtilities was resulting in the ignoring of URLs for FTP based CRLs. This has been fixed.\r\n - A regression in the OpenPGP API could cause NoSuchAlgorithmException to be thrown when attempting to use SHA-256 in some contexts. This has been fixed.\r\n - EtsiTs1029411TypesAuthorization was missing an extension field. This has been added.\r\n - Interoperability issues with single depth LMS keys have been addressed.\r\n \r\nAdditional Features and Functionality\r\n - CompositeSignatures now updated to draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs-03.\r\n - ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, and Composite private keys now use raw encodings as per the latest drafts from IETF 121: draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates-06, draft-ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates-05, and draft-ietf-lamps-x509-slhdsa.\r\n - Initial support has been added for RFC 9579 PBMAC1 in the PKCS API.\r\n - Support has been added for EC-JPAKE to the lightweight API.\r\n - Support has been added for the direct construction of S/MIME AuthEnvelopedData objects, via the SMIMEAuthEnvelopedData class.\r\n - An override \"org.bouncycastle.asn1.allow_wrong_oid_enc\" property has been added to disable new OID encoding checks (use with caution).\r\n - Support has been added for the PBEParemeterSpec.getParameterSpec() method where supported by the JVM.\r\n - ML-DSA/SLH-DSA now return null for Signature.getParameters() if no context is provided. This allows the algorithms to be used with the existing Java key tool.\r\n - HQC has been updated to reflect the reference implementation released on 2024-10-30.\r\n - Support has been added to the low-level APIs for the OASIS Shamir Secret Splitting algorithms.\r\n - BCJSSE: System property \"org.bouncycastle.jsse.fips.allowGCMCiphersIn12\" no longer used. FIPS TLS 1.2 GCM suites can now be enabled according to JcaTlsCrypto#getFipsGCMNonceGeneratorFactory (see JavaDoc for details) if done in alignment with FIPS requirements.\r\n - Support has been added for OpenPGP V6 PKESK and message encryption.\r\n - PGPSecretKey.copyWithNewPassword() now includes AEAD support.\r\n - The ASCON family of algorithms have been updated in accordance with the published FIPS SP 800-232 draft.",
